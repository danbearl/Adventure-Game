Dan's Adventure Game v0.3a

This text-based adventure game is my personal exercise for learning how to code in Ruby. As of now it is only a five-room
dungeon that tests various functions. Once I'm happy that the game has all of the functionality I want, I'll flesh it
out into a full dungeon and will progress its version to 1.0. Then I will increase functionality incrementally.

To run: First download and install Ruby on your local machine (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). Then download all
.rb files in this repository and from a command line type 'ruby adventure.rb' (without quotes, of course).
