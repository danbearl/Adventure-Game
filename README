Dan's Adventure Game v0.4a

This text-based adventure game is my personal exercise for learning how to code in Ruby. As of now it is only a five-room dungeon that tests various functions. Once I'm happy that the game has all of the functionality I want, I'll flesh it out into a full dungeon and will progress its version to 1.0. Then I will increase functionality incrementally.

To run: First download and install Ruby on your local machine (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). Then download all .rb files in this repository and from a command line type 'ruby adventure.rb' (without quotes, of course).


How to play:
This is a text-based adventure game. You are an adventurer exploring a dungeon, which is described to you, room by room in a text format. You interact with the game by typing commands and pressing enter when prompted. 
Valid commands and their formats:

help : displays list of valid commands

go [direction] : move in the direction indicated
[direction] : move in the direction indicated

inventory : show your current inventory
i: show your current inventory

look : describe the current room

get [item] : move an item from the current room into your inventory
get all: move all items from the current room into your inventory

drop [item] : move an item from your inventory into the current room
drop all : move all items from your inventory into the current room

wield [item] : start using an item as your weapon
wear [item] : start using an item as your armor

attack [creature] : attack a creature in the same room as you

put [item] in [item] : put an item from your inventory inside of another item, either in the current room or in your inventory

remove [item] from [item] : remove an item from another item and place it in your inventory

examine [item] : show a detailed description of the item

open [item] : opens a container item, allowing access to items contained within it

close [item] : close an open container item, hiding its contents

lock [item] with [item] : lock a container using the appropriate key item so that it cannot be opened until unlocked

refuel [item] with [item] : refuel a light source using the appropriate fuel type

light [item] : turn on a light source

extinguish [item] : turn off a light source

eat [item] : consume a food item

read [item] : read the contents of a readable item (books, scrolls, etc.)

quit : exit the game

The core functionality of the game is nearly complete, so next I will work on completing the dungeon to make it a fully playable game.

Any feedback is welcome!
